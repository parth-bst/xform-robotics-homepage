    <h1>Welcome to XFrom Robotics</h1>
    <h2>Redefining the Future with Authentic Robotics</h2>
    <p>
      At <b>XFrom Robotics</b>, we believe the world is ready for real, versatile robots—built with modules and logic unique to them, not merely imitating humans, but coexisting as new forms of life alongside us.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Mission:</b> Enable everyone to envision, build, and learn how to create robots that are truly robotic—modular, honest, and able to combine with other robotic tech.</li>
      <li><b>Vision:</b> In the future, robots will share the world with humans—not restricted by anthropomorphic conventions. House robots might not type on keyboards, but can patch into computers directly, or play music by interfacing natively with digital instruments.</li>
      <li>We encourage creativity: imagine a bi-pedal home robot composing code and music using virtualized interfaces, communicating via invisible USB links, or cooperating with smart appliances in ways only robots can.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Join us as we pioneer robots that look like robots—modular, functional, and designed to make the most of what machines can do, in harmony with human life.
